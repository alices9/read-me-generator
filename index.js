// # <Your-Project-Title>

// ## Description

// Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

// - What was your motivation?
// - Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
// - What problem does it solve?
// - What did you learn?

// ## Table of Contents (Optional)

// - [Installation](#installation)
// - [Usage](#usage)
// - [Credits](#credits)
// - [License](#license)

// ## Installation

// What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

// ## Usage

// Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

// To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

//     ```md
//     ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
//     ```

// ## Credits

// List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

// If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

// If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

// ## License

// The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
