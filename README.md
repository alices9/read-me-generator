# <README generator>

## Description

This application was created so that the user could create a professional README file on the fly! This will help the user save time when they are coding. While coding this application, I learned to create a question prompt list and write a function to obtain data from the user input to dynamically generate a new file.

## Installation

The user will need to install the inquirer npm package. When the application is run in the integrated terminal, the user will be prompted with questions to generate sections of their README file.

## Usage

The user can use this application to help them generate a professional README file for their repositories.
